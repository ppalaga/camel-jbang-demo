= Camel JBang demo

Prototype some Camel routes with https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_build_of_apache_camel/4.4/html/developer_tooling_guide/camel-jbang[Camel JBang CLI]:

* Produce some text messages by getting random jokes from https://api.chucknorris.io/[Chuck Norris API].
* Send the messages to a ActiveMQ Artemis queue.
* Bridge the Artemis queue to a Kafka topic.
* Receive the messages from Kafka.
* Perform some content-based filtering and routing.

Start editing the Camel route with live reload

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of Camel 4.6.0 and 4.4.2, the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-20771[live reload does not work for Java files]. The issue is https://github.com/apache/camel/commit/924ee0ab663562c48d6556a31d90d90272a94753[fixed] but not released yet.
====

[source,shell]
----
$ camel run demo.java --dev
...
INFO 33234 --- [           main] e.camel.impl.engine.AbstractCamelContext :     Started route1 (timer://java)
INFO 33234 --- [           main] e.camel.impl.engine.AbstractCamelContext : Apache Camel 4.6.0 (dem) started in 163ms (build:0ms init:0ms start:163ms)
INFO 33234 --- [ - timer://java] demo.java:14                             : Hello Camel from route1
INFO 33234 --- [ - timer://java] demo.java:14                             : Hello Camel from route1
...
----

Do some changes in the file

[source,java]
----
// camel-k: language=java

import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class dem extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {

        // Write your routes here, for example:
        from("timer:java?period={{time:1000}}")
            .setBody()
                // add JBang on the following line
                .simple("Hello Camel JBang from ${routeId}")
            .log("${body}");
    }
}
----

After that (if you run the https://github.com/apache/camel/commit/924ee0ab663562c48d6556a31d90d90272a94753[fixed] version of Camel, e.g. by adding `--camel-version=4.4.3-SNAPSHOT`) the application should be reloaded
and the changed output should appear on the console:

[source,shell]
----
INFO 33234 --- [ - timer://java] demo.java:14                        : Hello Camel from route1
INFO 34938 --- [rReloadStrategy] .support.RouteWatcherReloadStrategy : Routes reloaded summary (total:1 started:1)
INFO 34938 --- [rReloadStrategy] .support.RouteWatcherReloadStrategy :     Started route2 (timer://java) (source: demo.java:11)
INFO 34938 --- [ - timer://java] demo.java:14                        : Hello Camel JBang from route2
...
----

Have some fun by getting some random jokes from https://api.chucknorris.io/[Chuck Norris API]
by replacing the `from("timer:...").setBody(...)` for `kamelet:chuck-norris-source`:

[source,java]
----
        from("kamelet:chuck-norris-source?period=2000")
            .log("${body}");
----

... and see the live reload working again:

[source,shell]
----
INFO 34938 --- [ - timer://java] demo.java:14                        : Hello Camel JBang from route2
INFO 34938 --- [rReloadStrategy] .support.RouteWatcherReloadStrategy : Routes reloaded summary (total:1 started:1)
INFO 34938 --- [rReloadStrategy] .support.RouteWatcherReloadStrategy :     Started route2 (timer://java) (source: demo.java:11)
INFO 49469 --- [- timer://chuck] demo.java:11                        : Chuck Norris blows up ballons with his nose
----

== Add a legacy messaging broker

Start the broker

[source,shell]
----
$ docker run -e AMQ_USER=admin -e AMQ_PASSWORD=admin -p5672:5672 quay.io/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-broker:1.0.20
----

Change the route

[source,java]
----
        from("kamelet:chuck-norris-source?period=2000")
            .log("${body}")
            .to("amqp:queue:jokes");
----

It will not work, because we did not configure the connectionFactory

[source,shell]
----
...
org.apache.camel.FailedToStartRouteException: Failed to start route route2 because of connectionFactory must be specified
----

Rather than configuring the connection factory manually,
we may take the advantage of https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/next/reference/extensions/amqp.html#extensions-amqp-additional-camel-quarkus-configuration[Camel Quarkus AMQP extension] that configures the connection factory for us:

[quote]
The extension leverages the https://github.com/amqphub/quarkus-qpid-jms/[Quarkus Qpid JMS] extension. A ConnectionFactory bean is automatically created and wired into the AMQP component for you. The connection factory can be configured via the Quarkus Qpid JMS https://github.com/amqphub/quarkus-qpid-jms#configuration[configuration options].

So we let Camel JBang switch from using plain Camel to using Camel Quarkus under the hood:

[source,shell]
----
$ camel run demo.java --runtime=quarkus
Running using Quarkus v3.10.0 (preparing and downloading files)
...
INFO  [route1] (Camel (camel-1) thread #4 - timer://chuck) Sending to Artemis: Chuck Norris irons his clothes by wearing them.
----

[NOTE]
====
The `--dev` option will not work with `--runtime=quarkus`
====

We see the messages are being sent to Artemis without configuring anything
because the `quarkus-qpid-jms` happens to configure the connestion factory with `localhost:5672` and `admin admin` credentials.

== Bridge the Artemis queue to a Kafka topic

With the above setup, we do not see any exceptions in the console,
but to be sure that the messages pass the Artemis queue,
we better create a consumer that will forward the messages to a Kafka topic straight ahead.
To be sure that the messages pass the Kafka topic, we add another Camel route to consume them.

[source,java]
----
        from("amqp:queue:jokes")
            .log("Forwarding from Artemis to kafka: ${body}")
            .to("kafka:jokes");

        from("kafka:jokes")
             .log("Received from kafka: ${body}");
----

After restarting the app, we see the messages passing both brokers:

[source,shell]
----
INFO  [route1] (Camel (camel-1) thread #4 - timer://chuck) Sending to Artemis: Internet service dies each time someone on your ISP tries to submit a dry Chuck Norris fact.
INFO  [org.apa.qpi.jms.JmsConnection] (AmqpProvider :(5):[amqp://localhost:5672]) Connection ID:8cc380f3-ded1-4895-bce0-25e5d379cdfb:5 connected to server: amqp://localhost:5672
INFO  [route2] (Camel (camel-1) thread #2 - JmsConsumer[jokes]) Forwarding from Artemis to kafka: Internet service dies each time someone on your ISP tries to submit a dry Chuck Norris fact.
INFO  [route3] (Camel (camel-1) thread #3 - KafkaConsumer[jokes]) Received from kafka: Internet service dies each time someone on your ISP tries to submit a dry Chuck Norris fact.
----

== Content-based filtering and routing

Say that we want to do something special with messages starting with `Chuck`.

To do that, we can use the Camel https://camel.apache.org/components/next/eips/choice-eip.html[Choice EIP].
Then, based on the result of the content match, we may want to sent the message to a different Kafka topic:

[source,java]
----
        from("amqp:queue:jokes")
            .choice()
                .when(simple("${body.startsWith('Chuck')}"))
                    .log("Forwarding from Artemis to kafka:chuck: ${body}")
                    .to("kafka:chuck")
                .otherwise()
                    .log("Forwarding from Artemis to kafka:other: ${body}")
                    .to("kafka:other");
----

To be sure that the right jokes pass the right Kafka topic, we add some Kafka consumers:

[source,java]
----
        from("kafka:chuck")
            .log("Received from kafka:chuck: ${body}");

        from("kafka:other")
            .log("Received from kafka:other: ${body}");
----

== Visual editing with Kaoto

https://kaoto.io/[Kaoto] is a visual editor for Camel routes.
The underlying format is YAML.
See the https://kaoto.io/docs/installation/[installation options].

Here, we opened link:demo-finished.kaoto.yaml[] in Kaoto extension for VS code:

== Export to Maven

Once done with prototyping, we may want to setup a real Maven project.
That's pretty easy with Camel JBang:

[source,shell]
----
$ camel export --runtime=quarkus --gav=com.foo:acme:1.0-SNAPSHOT --directory=../camel-quarkus-demo
$ cd ../camel-quarkus-demo
$ ls -l .
total 36
-rwxr--r--. 1 ppalaga ppalaga 11289 May 17 13:21 mvnw
